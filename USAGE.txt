scenario-generator
==================

A simple scenario generator, written in Python

Originally written for my wife, this is a scenario generator to be used
during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) when you run out of things
to do with the story... load up the file and it will spit out a scenario
that you can use to continue with the story
